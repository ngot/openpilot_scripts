# Right hand drive mount

Due the camera on comma.ai is on the left side, the RHD has problem to detect the driver. A workaround is to mount the device a bit right of the central of the windscreen. In order to make openpilot work properly, the `CAMERA_OFFSET` in `selfdrive/controls/lib/lane_planner.py` need to adjusted to the correct value. The default value is 6cm from the left to the central, that's the distance of the camera to the central. Change the value to the actual value accordingly, for example my camera is 4cm from the right of the central, the value should be `-0.04`.
